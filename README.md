# Hext
Hext is a domain specific language for extracting structured content from
HTML documents.  

See http://hext.thomastrapp.com for
[documentation](http://hext.thomastrapp.com/documentation), 
[build instructions](http://hext.thomastrapp.com/download) and a live demo.

The Hext project is released under the terms of the *Apache License v2.0*.

### Example
This Hext snippet collects all Youtube videos from a Youtuber's channel page.
For example, if applied to https://www.youtube.com/user/CppCon/videos
you'll get a list of the most recent talks at CppCon with each item containing
the `duration`, `title`, `link`, `view_count` and `date_published`.

    <div class="yt-lockup-thumbnail">
      <span>
        <span class="video-time" @text:duration />
      </span>
    </div>
    <div class="yt-lockup-content">
      <h3>
        <a @text:title
           href:prepend("https://youtube.com"):link />
      </h3>
      <div class="yt-lockup-meta">
        <ul>
          <li @text:filter(/[^ ]+/):view_count />
          <li @text:date_published />
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

Visit [Hext's project page](http://hext.thomastrapp.com) to learn more about
Hext. For examples that use the libhext C++ library checkout `/libhext/examples`
and the
[main page of the doxygen documentation](http://hext.thomastrapp.com/libhext-documentation).

## Components
* `htmlext`: Command line utility that applies Hext snippets to an HTML document
  and produces JSON.
* `libhext`: C++ library that contains a Hext parser but also allows for
  customization.
* `libhext-test`: Unit tests for libhext.
* `Hext bindings`: Bindings for scripting languages. There are extensions for
  Python, Ruby and PHP that are able to parse Hext and extract values from HTML.
  Requires [Swig](http://www.swig.org/) for building.

## Dependencies for development
* [Ragel](http://www.colm.net/open-source/ragel/) generates the state machine
  that is used to parse Hext
* The unit tests for libhext are written with
  [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest)
* libhext's public API documentation is generated by
  [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/)
* libhext's scripting language bindings are generated by
  [Swig](http://www.swig.org/).

## Tests
There are unit tests for libhext and blackbox tests for Hext as a language,
whose main pupose is to detect unwanted change in syntax or behaviour.  
The libhext-test project is located in `/libhext/test` and depends on Google
Test. Nothing fancy, just build the project and run the executable
`libhext-test`. How to write test cases with Google Test is described
[here](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/Primer.md).  
The blackbox tests are located in `/test`. There you'll find a shell script
called `blackbox.sh`. This script applies Hext snippets to HTML documents and
compares the result to a third file that contains the expected output. For
example, there is a test case `icase-quoted-regex` that consists of three files:
`icase-quoted-regex.hext`, `icase-quoted-regex.html`, and
`icase-quoted-regex.expected`. To run this test case you would do the following:

    $ ./blackbox.sh case/icase-quoted-regex.hext

`blackbox.sh` will then look for the corresponding `.html` and `.expected` files
of the same name in the directory of `icase-quoted-regex.hext`. Then it will
invoke `htmlext` with the given Hext snippet and HTML document and compare the
result to `icase-quoted-regex.expected`. To run all blackbox tests in
succession:

    $ ./blackbox.sh case/*.hext

By default `blackbox.sh` will look for the `htmlext` binary in `$PATH`. Failing
that, it looks for the binary in the default build directory. You can tell
`blackbox.sh` which command to use by setting HTMLEXT. For example, to run all
tests through valgrind you'd run the following:

    $ HTMLEXT="valgrind -q ../build/htmlext" ./blackbox.sh case/*.hext

## Acknowledgements
* [Gumbo](https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser)
  — **An HTML5 parsing library in pure C99**  
  Gumbo is used as the HTML parser behind `hext::Html`. It's fast, easy to
  integrate and even fixes invalid HTML.
* [Ragel](http://www.colm.net/open-source/ragel/)
  — **Ragel State Machine Compiler**  
  The state machine that is used to parse Hext snippets is generated by Ragel.
  You can find the definition of this machine in `/libhext/ragel/hext-machine.rl`.
* [RapidJSON](http://rapidjson.org/)
  — **A fast JSON parser/generator for C++**  
  RapidJSON powers the JSON output of the `htmlext` command line utility.
* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
  — **A lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor**  
  An indispensable tool when dealing with JSON in the shell.
  Piping the output of `htmlext` into `jq` lets you do all sorts of crazy things.
* [Ace](https://ace.c9.io/) — **A Code Editor for the Web**  
  Used as the code editor in the
  "[Try Hext in your Browser!](http://hext.thomastrapp.com)" section and as a
  highlighter for all code examples. The highlighting rules for Hext are
  included in this project in `/syntaxhl/ace`. Also, there's a script in
  `/libhext/scripts/syntax-hl-ace` that uses Ace to transform a code snippet
  into highlighted HTML.
* [Proxygen](https://github.com/facebook/proxygen)
  — **A collection of C++ HTTP libraries including an easy to use HTTP server**  
  The HTTP server behind the "[Try Hext in your Browser!](http://hext.thomastrapp.com)"
  section is built with proxygen.
